  Legacy4J is currently incompatible with LEM and breaks multiple UI elements on LEM.

  ### If you are using Re-Console, make sure you are using version 0.5.3 or above. Previous versions have an issue that could result in a cheating ban.

  We are currently talking with the Legacy4J developers about this issue, and a solution is planned but it will take a significant amount of time to implement as a large amount of LEM's UIs will need to be remade to make this possible.

  **Do not harass the Legacy4J or LEM team about this issue, both of them are very aware of it.**

  Currently known issues with using Legacy4J on LEM:

  - Inability to use the voting book

  - UI elements in weird positions

  - UI elements failing to render

  - UI elements at incorrect scales

  - Incompatibility with LEM Client Helper

  To anyone curious as to why this happens, its because LEM's UI system was built around the expectation of the vanilla locations of UI elements. Legacy4J moves *all* of these UI elements in some way, causing the UI to look very broken. As for the voting book, Legacy4J doesn't have clickEvent support in book UIs.
