  ### February 15th Update:

  LEM has been in a closed alpha state for multiple years now, this was done due to major issues we had during our originaly public era. We were short staffed on moderators, LEM's codebase was a lot more buggy back then, and a lot of features were still missing.

  We originally planned to release once we had fixed all of the issues that we had, but its been almost 3 years since we entered our private era. We planned to be out of it 2 years ago.

  While not all of the issues mentioned above have been fixed, a good chunk of them have been resolved or are very close to being resolved. 2.0 is almost done, and it being not written in a datapack it will be a lot easier to add features to, almost all missing features are in 2.0 and we plan to have all of them in 2.0 once it launches.

  We've finally gotten into a state where we think we can safely launch the server into its second and hopefully permanent public era without too much issue, and to prevent having you all wait *another* few months to a year, we've decided it would be better to just do it now.

  A stress test is planned on February 15-16 where we will open the server to the public to see how it will handle it, and if everything goes right, it should go public **very soon.**
