  There are multiple reasons why the server is in a closed alpha state, listed here are the major ones that led to the decision to make the server a closed alpha.

  - Currently, we don't have enough moderators to handle the server in a public enviornment. We also still need to work on all the tools for said moderators.

  - The code for the server is still very unstable, there are plenty of bugs and issues that you **will** run into when playing the server in its current state.

  - Cheaters were a major issue before we decided to move to a closed alpha, showing up every few hours. We do not have enough moderators or a proper system for reporting said cheaters.

  - Many features are still not completed at the moment, for example the newer menu system is still very incomplete and lacks a lot of options.

  You can see the original blogpost about the server going into a closed alpha [here](../blog/where-has-lem-been).

  ### When will it go public again?

  With the development team being pretty small, it will take a long time to deal with all of these issues. We hope once its ready to go public again that we can avoid having all the issues we had before.
  
  There is no date that is set in stone for LEM going public, but it will likely either be late 2024 or in 2025.

  ### How can I join currently?

  It used to be possible to send an invite request to be able to join, however due to a huge influx of invite requests it became impossible to manage it with our current resources. We plan to work on going public instead of re-opening invite requests. In the meantime, check out [Weekend Events](../blog/weekendevents) for trying out the server.
