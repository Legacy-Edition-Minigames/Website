  "Clients" in the sense of Lunar Client, Badlion Client, Feather client, etc are not recommended for LEM. They very often break LEM's UI features and in some cases make the game near unplayable (Lunar Client for example), due to all of this it is highly suggested to use one of the options listed below instead.

  1 - [Console-idated](https://modrinth.com/modpack/console-idated): Console-idated is a modpack that attempts to mimic the look of LCE, and has LEM compatibility with few compromises.
  
  LEM Compatibility: Great<br><br>

  2 - [Additive](https://www.modrinth.com/modpack/additive): Additive is built off of Adrenaline aiming to be an alternative to OptiFine, it adds many features from OptiFine such as shaders, zoom, resource pack features and among other things.

  LEM Compatibility: Good<br><br>

  3 - [Fabulously Optimized](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions): FO is a modpack designed to improve the performance of Minecraft and works pretty well with LEM.

  LEM Compatibility: Good<br><br>

  4 - [Adrenaline](https://www.modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline): Adrenaline is a lightweight modpack that focuses on just improving the performance of Minecraft, it does not add any significant features. You should use this if you just want better performance than Vanilla and nothing else.

  LEM Compatibility: Good<br><br>

  5 - <u>Vanilla Minecraft</u>: Vanilla Minecraft works fine on LEM with no LEM-specific issues, but Vanilla is very poorly optimized. We recommend anything listed above over Vanilla.

  LEM Compatibility: Good
