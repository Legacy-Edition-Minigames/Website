  Things like new features, changes to existing features, improvements to the game, etc.. will be found here!
  
  Stay tuned for updates! And before you go, i'd like to mention that the Experimental Server does exist!

  The Experimental Server is used for testing new features that just arent fully stable for being available on all servers yet.

  As of writing this, the New Dimension Loader and ModTools/Modloader are available there!
  
  Go check it out! The ip for it is **test.legacyminigames.xyz**
