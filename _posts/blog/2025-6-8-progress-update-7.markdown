  # Welcome Back
  As you may have noticed, this is our first progress update in a while. There has been substantial progress on the 2.0 version of the server, and we are now beginning to test it. The code is still in an alpha state, and we do **not have a set timeframe for public release.**

  # Battle
  If you joined us during our april fools event this year, you got to experience an early version of the 2.0 rewrite, as part of the rewrite a lot of things have been changed, bringing massive improvements to server performance, and introducing new capabilities.

  ### LEMaddons
  
  LEMaddons, as mentioned in a previous progress update, are used by the server to load maps, the format for LEMaddons has been expanded to include loot-tables, and hunger settings.

  LEMaddon creators can now create their own loot tables, and hunger settings, in additon to maps.

  ### **UI element rendering**
  
  With the 2.0 rewrite, several UI elements have seen improvements, most notably the armor bar is now greatly improved for vanilla players.

  # Glide
  Glide has gone through some major revisions since the last (video) progress update.

  - Multiround functionality is now implemented
  - Thermal physics have been brought closer to their console counterparts
  - Players and Glide ghosts now fade out when approaching them
  - Booster colors have been improved

  # Minigames
  With the 2.0 rewrite, several notable bugs have been fixed including:

  - Players spawning in the air
  - Spectating your own spectator mob
  - Fountain Softlock in New Lobby

  ### Existing members
  If you are an existing whitelisted member on the discord, we have added a new 'player-invites' section where you can request for your friends or alt accounts to be added to the server whitelist using the /invite command.

  The experimental server will soon be switching over to test the 2.0 version of the server, please continue to report bugs or other issues encoutereed to the bugs and issues channel, making sure to add the 'Experimental Server' tag when posting.

  ### What's left
  While the team continues working on the server to get it ready for a full public launch, you can join the server during our weekend [livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/@LegacyMinigames/streams), which are usually scheduled for sundays.

  # Changes to progress updates
  There are 2 new changes to how progress updates are going to be handled:

  - The [video versions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtHQsKobsxzbW6f5uStXNY2PIz03cRtDo) of the progress updates are now being synced up with the blogpost versions, the blog versions will contain the same information as the video version, sometimes going into more detail in some sections or bonus sections (like this one)

  - We are changing how we label and post progress updates slightly, we are no longer tying it to months and instead numbering them sequentially. This one is number 7, to match the video version of this progress update.

  Thank you for your patience with us, when we have a release estimate ready, we will let you know.
