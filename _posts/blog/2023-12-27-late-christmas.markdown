  Merry (late) Christmas! We're doing an event this weekend (December 30th to 31st)

  What is this event you might ask? We're temporarily opening the server up to the public on the weekend to see how it does. There will be no sign-ups or anything like that required to participate, If you've been thinking introducing some friends to the project this would be a great time to do so!

  The event is planned to last for 2 days, but depending on the conditions might last longer and the server might temporarily re-enter its closed state if no moderators are able to keep an eye on the server at the time. (We will try our best to prevent this though!)

  We hope everyone involved has fun, see you there!

  The event has ended

  Thanks to everyone who participated! If you would like to keep playing please make an Invite Request!
