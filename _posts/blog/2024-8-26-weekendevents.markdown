  You may not have noticed, but we are now doing public events every weekend on our YouTube channel!

  This is being done to allow more people to try LEM before it releases, since it is taking a while for LEM to be ready for going public.

  You may not have noticed, but we are now doing public events every weekend on our YouTube channel!

  This is being done to allow more people to try LEM before it releases, since it is taking a while for LEM to be ready for going public.

  Every weekend we will do a livestream on the LEM YouTube channel, the length of the events can vary greatly depending on the avilability of moderators. We will likely only do it on one day of the weekend due to the limited availbility of moderators currently.
  
  We will try to schedule the livestream a day before so you know when to be ready. Upcoming livestreams will show up [here!](https://www.youtube.com/@LegacyMinigames/streams)

  **Note:** These livestreams are based on moderator availability, which means these may not *always* happen, but we will try our best.
