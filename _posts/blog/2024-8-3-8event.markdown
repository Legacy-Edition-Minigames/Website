  We are doing a Public Event! (August 8th)

  We're temporarily opening the server up to the public on the 8th. There will be no sign-ups or anything like that required to participate, If you've been wanting to try the server out before it goes public this would be your chance!

  The event is planned to last for just one day, but depending on the conditions might last longer and the server might temporarily re-enter its closed state if no moderators are able to keep an eye on the server at the time. (We will try our best to prevent this though!)

  We hope everyone involved has fun, see you there!

  # The event is currently active!
