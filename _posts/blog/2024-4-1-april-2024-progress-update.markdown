  Welcome! You can probably tell that we've made some pretty big changes to the LEM project. No time to waste, lets get started!

  ### The big change

  We have decided to move away from 3D development to 2D development, why???

  After a lot of internal discussion between the moderators and developers, we have decided that 3D development is just too difficult. We know this is a very controversial decision but we beleive this will allow us to move at a much faster pace without needing to account for the third dimension.

  Since Minecraft is a 3D game, we need to move to another game to allow for this kind of change, the closest option has been chosen: Terraria!

  ### What now?

  The move to 2D will allow us to add more features much more quickly, this means the following features are in development and will arrive soon:

  - 100 New Weapons

  - The ability to cook meals

  - Randomly generated maps

  - Larger inventory host option

  - Better server performance

  - And more!

  To celebrate this, we are temporarily making the server public for the entirety of April 1st!

  We thank everyone here for their understanding of why we would of made such a decision like this. We hope to see you in Terraria: Legacy Edition Minigames!
