  Welcome! You can probably tell that we've made some pretty big changes to the LEM project. No time to waste, lets get started!

  ### The big change

  We have decided to move away from 3D development to 2D development, why???

  After a lot of internal discussion between the moderators and developers, we have decided that 3D development is just too difficult. We know this is a very controversial decision but we beleive this will allow us to move at a much faster pace without needing to account for the third dimension.

  Since Minecraft is a 3D game, we need to move to another game to allow for this kind of change, the closest option has been chosen: Terraria!

  ### What now?

  The move to 2D will allow us to add more features much more quickly, this means the following features are in development and will arrive soon:

  - 100 New Weapons

  - The ability to cook meals

  - Randomly generated maps

  - Larger inventory host option

  - Better server performance

  - And more!

  # To celebrate this, we are temporarily making the server public for the entirety of April 1st!

  We thank everyone here for their understanding of why we would of made such a decision like this. We hope to see you in Terraria: Legacy Edition Minigames!
