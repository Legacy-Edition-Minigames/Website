  The LEM YouTube channel now has 1000 subscribers! Thank you!
  
  As a thanks, we are doing a Public Event this weekend! (June 15-16)

  We're temporarily opening the server up to the public on the weekend. There will be no sign-ups or anything like that required to participate, If you've been wanting to try the server out before it goes public this would be your chance!

  The event is planned to last for 2 days, but depending on the conditions might last longer and the server might temporarily re-enter its closed state if no moderators are able to keep an eye on the server at the time. (We will try our best to prevent this though!)

  We hope everyone involved has fun, see you there!

  The event has ended!

  Thanks to everyone who participated! We hope to see you again soon!
