  Hello! You may or may not have noticed that the domain for this project is now legacyminigames**.net** and not legacyminigames**.xyz**, there's a bit more of an explanation to this than you'd expect for this kind of change.

  ### Why was it changed again so recently? Wasn't it changed july?

  Back when we did the domain change, the .net domain was already taken by someone else. At the time we didn't know who owned the domain, we didn't find much about it when looking into it. However on October 25th the owner of legacyminigames.net, FoxPodZ contacted us via an invite request talking about their project.

  ### What was legacyminigames.net being used for?

  legacyminigames.net was another project that remade LCE minigames, it was a much newer project than LEM, only being made 6 months ago (as of writing this) and was not available to anyone except the developers. The project did not get too far in development as it was only 4 months old when they discovered LEM.

  ### How did FoxPodZ find LEM?

  The maintainers of this project were completely unaware of LEM's existence until a few months after legacyminigames.xyz was registered as a domain. The way they found out about LEM was actually someone FoxPodZ knows mentioning to him that they noticed that the same domain name was registered under a different TLD (.xyz instead of .net) and from there the invite request was sent.

  ### How did LEM get the .net domain?

  In the invite request FoxPodZ sent, he offered to give us the legacyminigames.net domain since he was no longer using it after finding LEM, which we happily accepted. It took a while for the transfer to occur, which is why this is only happening now.

  ### Will this happen again?

  Probably not. We didn't expect any of this to happen and thought we would never of gotten the .net domain.

  We will stay with the legacyminigames.net domain for the forseeable future.

  Thank you for taking your time to read this! Thats it for this blogpost, ~~we'll see you in the November progress update!~~
