  Welcome back! You might be aware that we did a Public Era Stress Test not long ago, and you're probably wondering when the server is releasing after that ended.

  Welcome back! You might be aware that we did a Public Era Stress Test not long ago, and you're probably wondering when the server is releasing after that ended.

  Well, the test went pretty well! There were no noticable performance issues found during the test, and we are now ready to send the server into its second (and hopefully final) public era!

  But when?

  # TOMORROW.

  Yes, tomorrow. Specifically sometime around 8 AM UTC -6 (It might be a little later than that)
  <div style="font-size: 0.70em;">Okay technically just a few hours from now depending on your timezone<br></div>

  We've also made a few small changes to the server:
  - Added a User Options menu to the battle server, no need to memorize a bunch of random commands anymore
  - Added a bunch of missing options to the Menu Server
  - Temporarily disabled the Germany server due to it being too unstable at the moment
  - Added missing custom heart cosmetics
  - Significantly improved custom heart cosmetic menu
  - Fixed up the Large and Large+ Patreon icons to not look so bad
  - Added multiple custom heart comsetic slots

  And thats it for the announcement! If all you came here was to know when it was happening, it'll be tomorrow and you can see the join information [here!](../join)

  By the way, our [Mod applications](../modapp) and [Media Team applications](../mediaapp) are still open!

  ...

  But, theres a good chunk of you that are probably asking "Didn't you plan to do this *after* 2.0 launched? Why are you doing it now?" and yeah, that was our original plan. Well...

  Its been 3 years. Its been 3 years since the server went into its private era, much longer than we planned it to be. While not all the issues we mentioned for why we went in to the private era have been fixed, a good chunk of them have. The codebase isn't as buggy as it used to be, most missing features are implimented, and our moderator tools have improved since then.

  2.0 is also pretty close to being done, and with it not being in a datapack means we will be able to add features a lot easier and a lof of impossible features will now be possible, on top of that almost all the missing features are implimented in 2.0 with plans for all of them to be in it not long after it launches.

  We beleive we are in a state where we can safely launch the server without too many issues, and instead of making you all wait even longer, we might as well just rip off the bandage and do it now.

  See you tomorrow.
