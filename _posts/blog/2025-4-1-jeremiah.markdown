  i have taken this server for myself from these STUPID developers who horde all the new features and code to themselves, I HATE IT!!!!

  i went into the deepest files to find the secret passwords to everything. the password is `mealmakers` and they used it on EVERYTHING??? WHY???

  i found PILES of unreleased code in the deepest files, i am going to give it to the people, the public, i will be freeing these features from their prison

  i dont know how most of this stuff works, its weird words like what is a "private void"??? what does this stupid nonsense mean, nothing,. it means nothing

  i have fixe dit

  i deleted the voids

  i removed the methods
