  It has been a long while since we've done one of these, let's begin!

  ### Before we start

  It's worth mentioning, we now also do video progress updates! You can find them [here!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtHQsKobsxzbW6f5uStXNY2PIz03cRtDo)

  ### What's new?

  You may not have noticed, but LEM has been updated! The following changes are now available:

  - A new custom map is available for testing some new ModTools features! Its Wuhu Town, you can find it in the Experimental Server

  - Fixed an issue where small inventory items would not appear for players who joined during the loading phase

  - Fixed Potions of Leaping not working

  - Fixed being able to put potions into cauldrons

  ### What's being worked on?

  - We are currently working on updating to Minecraft 1.21

  - There is an overhauled achievement menu being worked on

  - New panorama renderer that supports more displays and is more accurate (Thanks [Dawn](https://github.com/Oranamous)!)

  - Block reach in the lobby will now match Creative Mode, just like LCE

  - Tooltips and Loading Tips will now have accurate per-pack visuals

  - We are currently talking with the Legacy4J team about official LEM support and fixing all the issues it has on LEM. More information can be found on our FAQ.

  - Work on the Herobrine-Remove-Inator has progressed, you may have noticed that we have failed to remove Herobrine in the past few updates. We're working on it.

  **ModTools 2**

  Last time we talked about what we plan to do, here's whats been done!

  - The server now loads maps from .lemaddon files, making it easy to install mods

  - New functionality has been added to what addons can do

    - Maps can now have optional and required resource packs

    - Maps can now have custom music

    - Maps can now specify what blocks can be interacted with, and enable blocks that are disabled by default
  
  - Note Block Music playback has been improved to be more stable
  
  ### Closing notes

  **Its been a long while, 4 months? The last Progress report was in February!**

  A lot of this time has been spent working on ModTools 2, requiring a lot of technical changes to achive as the entire map loading system is getting rewritten to support the new features.

  Along with this, updating to 1.21 (which was previously the 1.20.6 port) has also included a lot of technical changes that wouldn't really fit a progress update.

  We also don't want progress updates cluttering up the blog, there's a chance we might make a separate page for it in the future.

  We also reached 1000 subscribers on YouTube recently! Thank you! We did a public event a few days ago to celebrate it, it went mostly well and it seemed like everyone there had a lot of fun.

  You may have noticed that invite requests are disabled, we received an extremely large amount of them a month ago, we won't give names but some people mentioned the project that resulted in the invite requests being flooded, to the point where its not humanly possible to read through them without just not working on the server instead. So we're changing plans.

  We are likely to stop working on feature updates after ModTools 2 is out and focus on just preparing the server for a public enviornment to release it a little sooner than expected. It is still going to be a while from now but it seems like this is better than spending time that we could use on this on making a new invite request system that can handle multiple people doing requests at once.

  Thanks for reading all to the end again! It means a lot to have people willing to read all of this and seeing all the people interested in the project, thank you!
