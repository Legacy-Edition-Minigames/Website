  Welcome back once again. Yes, you didn't misread that, we are planning to do a **stress test for the server entering the public era.**

  We are using this as a way to judge if the server is ready capacity and performance wise for us entering the public era, if everything goes right, LEM should go public shortly after this event ends.

  The event will be on the 15th and 16th. It might get extended depending on how things go.

  We will be posting a much larger blogpost explaining why this is happening sooner than later, but for now...

  # Come join us on the 15th and 16th for the stress test!
