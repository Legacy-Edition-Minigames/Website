  A new resource version is now available!
  
  R26.4 introduces a few new features, notably 1.19.3 support
  
  Added Features:

  - Added support for Minecraft 1.19.3

  - Added an option to disable music that might be claimed on YouTube or Twitch (/trigger safemusic)

  - Added LCE style item tooltips

  - Added mini game logo to tablist

  - Added Natural texture pack as an option for ModTools creators

  - Fixed hotbar UI having a shadow in 1.19.1 and above

  - Removed shadows from a bunch of Custom UI elements

  - Fixed paintings that had transparency in their texture having a black background

  - Plus some other tweaks!

  Unfortunately, due to some features in this update that require 1.17+ features, **1.16 version support is being dropped in this update**
