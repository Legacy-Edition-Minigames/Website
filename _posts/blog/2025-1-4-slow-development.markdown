  LEM development has been slow recently, so... what's been happening with the project over the past few months?

  Being honest, not much. Most of the development team has been experiencing a lot of availability and personal issues ever since the middle of 2024. We won't get into the details, but it feels like we're due to give an explanation for the lack of progress and what our plans are from here on out.

  LEM development has been slow recently, so... what's been happening with the project over the past few months?

  Being honest, not much. Most of the development team has been experiencing a lot of availability and personal issues ever since the middle of 2024. We won't get into the details, but it feels like we're due to give an explanation for the lack of progress and what our plans are from here on out.

  We are currently still slowly working on the LEM rewrite. Progress on it has picked up a bit, and we did perform an internal test with mostly successful results! You will more than likely see things start to pick up again once the rewrite reaches a stage of public testing.

  Once the rewrite is complete, we will begin preparing for the public beta launch. This will require a lot of changes to be made to the existing moderation tools, and that may take a long period of time.

  After we enter the public beta stage, we will focus on finishing the work done on ModTools 2. Our goal from there is completing the other two minigames.

  We can't give an ETA, as every time we've done that, it has been very far off. However, we are aiming to reach the Public Era by early 2025. No promises, as we are still a small team of people doing all of this in our spare time! Thank you for your continued support.
