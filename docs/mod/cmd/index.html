<div class="guibox center">
	<b>Evidence note</b>
	<p>If you suspect someone of breaking the rules, you should do what you can to collect evidence.<br>
	You should have screen recording software set up before you begin moderating, and Replay Mod if possible.<br></p>
	<p>Once you have collected evidence, post it in the #report-evidence channel on Discord.
		<b>Note:</b> Make sure to check if a post has already been made for that player before making one!</p>
