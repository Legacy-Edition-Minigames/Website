	<h1>VERY Important Note</h1>
		<p>Any evidence uploaded to a channel in the Player Reports category should be <b>Downloaded and reuploaded</b> to #report-evidence, do <i>not</i> copy the link to the evidence and post it there.</p>
		<p><b>ALL files uploaded to a channel in Player Reports will be deleted once /close it run.</b></p>
		<p>We plan on automating this process in the future, but for now all evidence must be manually saved.</p>
