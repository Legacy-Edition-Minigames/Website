	<h1>Minecraft Punishments via Discord</h1>
		<p>These are the commands for the Discord server for issuing punishments to the Minecraft server.</p>
		<p>These do not sync with the Discord server at the moment, we plan on having it sync in the near future.</p>

	<h1>Important Note</h1>
		<p><b>Note:</b> To run commands, you will run them from Discord's slash command menu under the bot Derpbot 3.</p>
		One of the options in most commands is a <span style="color: #0000AA">Server</span> option, the options are as follows:<br>
		<span style="color: #0000AA">menu</span> - Menu Server<br>
		<span style="color: #0000AA">main</span> - Battle Main<br>
		<span style="color: #0000AA">alt</span> - Battle Alternate<br>
		<span style="color: #0000AA">exp</span> - Battle Experimental<br>
		<span style="color: #0000AA">germany</span> - Battle Germany
		<p>This will determine what server the command will run inside of, if you don't pick anything it will default to the Menu server.</p>
		<p>Note for commands with a <span style="color: #0000AA">[Duration]</span> option, you may specify <span style="color: #0000AA">none</span> to make your punishment permanent.</p>

	<h2>Warns</h2>
	<b>Note:</b> Warns will only appear when the player is in the server, if they disconnect before being warned they will never see it. This will be fixed in the near future.<br>
	For now, issue a lesser version of the next punishment, for example if they were spamming chat, mute them for a day instead.<br><br>
