	<h2>Moderator Menu</h2>
	<p>To handle some in-game situations, there are a few options in the moderator menu:</p>
	<p>- <b>Spectator Mob Override</b>: This can be used to either hide your spectator from cheaters, or change it to a vex to try to get them to trigger a cheat on a "hostile mob"<br>
	- <b>LEMClientHelper List</b>: Useful for knowing how to respond someone asking if they have LCH installed<br>
	- <b>Reset Host Options</b>: Resets the game options, useful if someone is intentionally trying to make gameplay bad<br>
	- <b>Disable Multirounds</b>: Removes all the remaining rounds in a game.<br>
	- <b>Force End Round</b>: Forces the current round to end.</p>
	<b>/trigger moderator</b><br>

	<h2>Suspicious Players</h2>
	<p>Players can be marked as suspicious if they are potentially breaking the rules, marking them as suspicious will ping the @xof role on Discord when they join the server.<br>
	You can add the xof role to yourself in Discord using the /role command.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> This command doesn't have a [Reason] option yet, and we plan on fixing this soon.</p>
