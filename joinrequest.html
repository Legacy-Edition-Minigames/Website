	<h1>Request an Invite</h1>
		<p>Legacy Edition Minigames is currently in a <b>closed alpha.</b></p>
		<p>You <b>will</b> run into bugs and issues, please understand that the experience will not be completely polished.</p>
		<p>The time it takes to have your request reviewed is inconsistent, it takes on average <b>a few days</b> to be reviewed.</p>
		<p>If you would like to skip the line, you may join our patreon (starting at $2)</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Actions you have taken before the closed alpha <i>will</i> impact if you are accepted and can impact the time it takes to be reviewed. <b>If you are banned, you will need to appeal that ban first.</b></p>
