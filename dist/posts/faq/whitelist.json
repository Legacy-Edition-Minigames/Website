  "mainText": "There are multiple reasons why the server is in a closed alpha state, listed here are the major ones that led to the decision to make the server a closed alpha.\n\n- Currently, we don't have enough moderators to handle the server in a public enviornment. We also still need to work on all the tools for said moderators.\n\n- The code for the server is still very unstable, there are plenty of bugs and issues that you **will** run into when playing the server in its current state.\n\n- Cheaters were a major issue before we decided to move to a closed alpha, showing up every few hours. We do not have enough moderators or a proper system for reporting said cheaters.\n\n- Many features are still not completed at the moment, for example the newer menu system is still very incomplete and lacks a lot of options.\n\nYou can see the original blogpost about the server going into a closed alpha [here](../blog/where-has-lem-been).\n\n### When will it go public again?\n\nWith the development team being pretty small, it will take a long time to deal with all of these issues. We hope once its ready to go public again that we can avoid having all the issues we had before.\n\nThere is no date that is set in stone for LEM going public, but it will likely either be late 2024 or in 2025.\n\nTo clarify, **it does not cost money to join the Closed Alpha.** Joining the server's Patreon simply lets you skip the waiting line to join. If you are interested in joining, you can see more at the [Join page](../join).\n",
