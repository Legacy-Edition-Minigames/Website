You should use this if you just want better performance than Vanilla and nothing else.\n\nLEM Compatibility: Good<br><br>\n\n5 - <u>Vanilla Minecraft</u>: Vanilla Minecraft works fine on LEM with no LEM-specific issues, but Vanilla is very poorly optimized. We recommend anything listed above over Vanilla.\n\nLEM Compatibility: Good\n",
