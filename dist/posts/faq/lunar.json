It has reached a point where the game is unplayable, and here we have a list of everything it breaks.\n\n<style>\nh2 {text-align: center;}\n</style>\n## Current known issues\n\n1 - In the host menu, the chat and most Vanilla UI elements is not visible, and it is only possible to start the game with /trigger lem.gamecfg at this point.\n\n2 - Commonly, all entities (Players, Chests, Armor Stands, etc.) fail to render, making them invisible. This makes the game essentially unplayable at this state.\n\n3 - Many UI elements that use the bossbar to render break, such as the battle banner and panorama.\n\n## What you can do\n\nWhile you can't play with Lunar Client, you can see our list of compatible Modpacks [here](modpack)",
