No time to waste, lets get started!\n\n### The big change\n\nWe have decided to move away from 3D development to 2D development, why???\n\nAfter a lot of internal discussion between the moderators and developers, we have decided that 3D development is just too difficult. We know this is a very controversial decision but we beleive this will allow us to move at a much faster pace without needing to account for the third dimension.\n\nSince Minecraft is a 3D game, we need to move to another game to allow for this kind of change, the closest option has been chosen: Terraria!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gfc877yfDLM?si=uziI9zH_I5iC-nao\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### What now?\n\nThe move to 2D will allow us to add more features much more quickly, this means the following features are in development and will arrive soon:\n\n- 100 New Weapons\n\n- The ability to cook meals\n\n- Randomly generated maps\n\n- Larger inventory host option\n\n- Better server performance\n\n- And more!\n\n# To celebrate this, we are temporarily making the server public for the entirety of April 1st!\n\nWe thank everyone here for their understanding of why we would of made such a decision like this. We hope to see you in Terraria: Legacy Edition Minigames!\n",
