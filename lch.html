	<h1>LEM Client Helper</h1>
		<p>LEM Client Helper is an optional enhancement mod for the server that adds some features that aren't possible on vanilla.<br>
			You do not need LCH installed to play on LEM or get most of the experience, it is just an optional enhancement.
		</p>
		<p>LCH requires you to already have installed the Fabric Loader and its API, it does not support Forge currently.</p>
		<p><b>Important note:</b> Make sure you install the 1.20.4 versions of Fabric and Fabric API! LCH currently has not been ported to LEM 2.0 yet.</p>
		<span style="color: #AA0000; text-shadow: 1.25px 1px #2A0000">LEM Client Helper is incompatible with Legacy4J currently.</span>
