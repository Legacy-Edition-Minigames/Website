  "mainText": "<script>\n  var overide = true;\n  var halloweenModeCheck = true;\n</script>\nWelcome back! There's been a lot that has changed since the last time we've posted one of these, lets get started!\n\n### What's new?\n\nYou may not have noticed, but LEM has been updated! The following changes are now available:\n\n- **More detailed Armor and Arrows** Armor and Tipped Arrows will now properly display info about them when hovering your mouse on them.\n\nArmor: Amount of armor points given to the player.\n\nArrows: Amount of time the effect will last.\n\n  <img src=\"../assets/blog/october-2023-progress-update/armorarrows.png\" class=\"pixelated\">\n\n- **Fixed win detector** The win detector has been fixed and should now properly find who has won the game every time.\n\n- **New Death Options** There are 2 new game options introduced in the Combat Options menu. You can find these options in the Death Options page in Combat Options.\n\n  <img src=\"../assets/blog/october-2023-progress-update/deathoptions.png\" class=\"pixelated\">\n\n  - **Item Drop Behavior** Allows you to change what happens to items once a player dies.\n\n  Normal: Vanilla behavior, items are dropped onto the ground.\n\n  Keep: Items do not drop and players keep their items upon respawning.\n\n  Clear: Items are cleared from the player's inventory and do not get dropped.\n\n  - **Quick Item Despawning** When a player drops items from dying, they will despawn within a few seconds.\n\n- **Fixed broken weapon damage** Some weapons (Axes, Shovels, and Tridents) have been dealing 1 extra point of damage. This has been fixed by applying the extra point of damage to all weapons, along with fixing the displayed damage for enchanted weapons.\n\n- **Console Damage Combat Option** This option allows you to revert the extra point of damage being applied to all weapons. This can be found in the Custom combat type, and will be turned off when using Modern combat.\n\n- Removed herobrine, twice.\n\n### What's being worked on?\n\n- **Recon Mode** Recon Mode will allow players to explore a map alone and test certain scenarios, there will be infinite respawns and no time limit. This feature will only be available in Private Rooms once they are available.\n\n- **Respawn Gear game option** This game option will give players weapons, tools, food, etc.. upon respawning in a round with multiple lives. The items given will change depending on how long the match has been going on for.\n\n### Closing notes\n\nYou're probably already aware, but we didn't do a progress update last month. This was due to the majority of things being worked on being backend changes or updates we've already covered in previous progress updates. We've also been much more busy with things going on outside of LEM.\n",
