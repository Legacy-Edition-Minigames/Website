Joining the server address **germany.legacyminigames.xyz** (Recommended!)\n\n2. using /server battle_germany from the US server\n\n**Note:** using /server will not address ping related problems! Only use this if connecting directly proves to be too unstable.\n\nIf you have issues connecting to the US servers, using /server from the Germany server might improve connection stability\n",
