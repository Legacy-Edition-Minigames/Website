		<h2>Closing notes</h2>
			<b>Use common sense.</b><br>
			Not every single scenario is accounted for in this list of rules, that does not mean you can play around the edges of these rules.<br><br>
			Moderators may issue any punishment they see fit, with the consensus of other moderators.<br><br>
			Please comply with all warnings and advisement from the moderation team. Technicalities are not exceptions from moderation discretion.<br><br>
			Actions outside of this server can be judged under the rules of this server for moderation actions. Moderation is, at the end of the day, to keep users in a particular space feeling safe and comfortable, and if a user does not feel comfortable with another user due to actions outside of the server, it's still potentially a justified feeling which shouldn't be ignored.
