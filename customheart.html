	<h1>Custom Heart Cosmetic</h1>
		<p>Being a LEM Standard Supporter and up, you are able to create a custom heart cosmetic to use in the server!</p>
		<p>You first need to make the texture for your heart cosmetic, your texture <b>must</b> be 256x256 or lower in resolution (though we don't recommend going that high)</p>
		<p>You may optionally make a dead variant of your texture, or you can just fallback to the built-in dead texture.</p>
		<h3>Suggestions</h3>
		<p>Here are also some suggestions for your texture:<br>
		- Keep the resolution 32x32 or lower (32x32 is still kind of pushing it)<br>
		- Try to stay in the style of the rest of the heart cosmetics<br>
		- Keep in mind that the tablist is tiny, stuff like text will not be readable unless its a single letter</p>
		<p>These suggestions are not required to get your heart cosmetic approved, but you should probably follow them for it to look good next to everything else.</p>
